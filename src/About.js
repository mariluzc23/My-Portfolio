                <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a dedicated and adaptable professional with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, specializing in Management, and a solid foundation in customer service and leadership. My career began over a decade ago in the banking industry, where I excelled as a teller and later advanced to a lead teller position at JPMorgan Chase. This role honed my attention to detail, organizational skills, and ability to manage teams effectively.</p>
                <p>A pivotal moment in my career journey was the passing of my father, which prompted me to reassess my long-term goals and pursue a path more closely aligned with my passion. My interest in technology, sparked by an elective coding class in college, led me to enroll in a coding bootcamp. This experience deepened my love for software development and confirmed my decision to transition into the tech industry.</p>
                <p>Although my initial attempts to move into a tech role within JPMorgan Chase did not materialize, my commitment to this career change remains unwavering. I chose to leave my role after ten successful years to focus on my family and continue developing my technical skills. As a stay-at-home mom, I have remained engaged in learning and refining my coding abilities, eager to apply them in a professional setting.</p>
                <p>I am now actively seeking opportunities to enter the tech industry, bringing my unique blend of business acumen, leadership experience, and technical training. I am confident that my diverse background and strong work ethic will allow me to contribute meaningfully to a forward-thinking team.</p>
